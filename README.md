# Benford-s-Law
What is Benford's Law and how it is used for Fraud Detection?  A recent episode in a Netflix show called 'Connected' talked about pattern followed by natural numbers called Benford's Law. According to this strange law, the probability of a digit 'd' appearing in a set of natural numbers is equal to log(1+1/d) with base 10. In other words, given a dataset and first digits of numbers in a column, if that dataset is not manipulated, then most likely, the probability of the occurrence of digits is [30.1, 17.6, 12.5, 9.7, 7.9, 6.7, 5.8, 5.1, 4.6] for 1-9 digits respectively.  This law is utilized in catching financial frauds and to raise red flags if deemed suspicious. It's mind-boggling that everything that involves numbers and not handcrafted follow Benford's Law.
